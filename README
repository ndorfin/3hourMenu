An attempt at a multi-tiered JSON-powered menu in under 3 hours.

Notes:
Only intended to work in standards-compliant browsers such as Firefox 6 and Chrome edge.
No use of frameworks such as jQuery (The pressure!)


HTML Notes:
Uses HTML5 elements such as <menu> and <nav>.
<head> and <body> elements are assumed and not required.
CSS references at the top of the document.
Script references at the bottom of the document.

JS Notes:
Not sure if an object + method approach is best here, but I figured it best to bind all actions off a menu object.
